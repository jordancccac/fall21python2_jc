# Icon Project 

## Part A: Description

      For this project, python will transform sequences of data into a simple image. 
      
## Part B: Functionality 

      The user creates an icon on a 10x10 grid through a combination of shaded and unshaded blocks. 
      
      The blocks represent sequences of binary code, where shaded blocks are represented
      by the number 1 (on) and unshaded blocks are represented by the number 0 (off). 
      
      Python will read in 100 bits of data (i.e. the 10x10 grid) that are in a data structure,
      which is a dictionary; the keys will be row numbers, which can help keep the user organized
      when entering the data; the values will be a list of numbers (e.g. {'1': [1,0,0,1,1]}.
      
      To transform the data into an image, Python will print a single character (e.g. an asterik-*-)
      for every bit that is the number 1 and will print nothing for all the 0 bits. 
      
      There is no user interface; the user will hard-code in the data bits (*program may be modified 
      in the future to include a user interface or modified to read in a CSV which contains the bits
      of data in a grid of cells). 
      
      The data bits are written to a JSON file to be saved to memory to avoid having to re-type 
      in the data any time the user wants to run the program.
