# Project: Blood Lead Levels in Pittsburgh-area School Districts 

## Part 1: Description 
 
### A: 

    This project focuses on a data set that measured lead levels
    in school districts by testing blood in children under 6 years of age.
    
    The data was collected over 6 years: 2015-2020. 
    The annual percentages represent the percent of children (*the total number tested*) who had 
    blood lead levels equal to or greater than 5 micrograms of lead per decileter of blood.
    

    Testing the code blocks.
    Hope it works!
