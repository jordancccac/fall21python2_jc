## Hunting Analytics Final Project 

### Research Questions

    This guiding research questions of this project were:
    
     1. What (if any) is the relationship between the number of hunting accidents and the number of hunting licenses, permits, tags and stamps acquired annually (i.e. this may
    suggest the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of hunter education/safety programs)?
    
     2. What is the average accident rate of hunting events over the period in question? This may suggest the inherent risk or danger of hunting.
