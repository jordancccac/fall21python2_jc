## Hunting Safety Analytics Final Project 

### Background 
    
    This program aims to shed light on the safety of hunting, as well as the nature of hunting accidents. 
    It draws on two sources of data: hunting accidents nationwide and the number of licenses, tags, permits 
    and stamps acquired each year. While the data is publicly available, the national incident database 
    appears to be missing pieces of data for some states/years. 

### Research Questions

    The guiding research questions of this project are:
    
     1. What (if any) is the relationship between the number of hunting accidents and the number of hunting licenses, permits, tags and
     stamps acquired annually (i.e. this may suggest the effectiveness of a state's hunting safety rules and regulations)?
    
     2. What is the average accident rate of hunting events over the period in question? 
     
     3. Accident Details: other factors are analyzed, including casualty rate, animals hunted, and tree-stand involvement,
     to help illuminate the safety-status of hunting and trends of accidents. 
     
     Future Research: Find the states with the highest and lowest accident rates, and then compare their safety rules and regulations.
