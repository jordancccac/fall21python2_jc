## Hunting Safety Analytics Final Project 

### Background 
    
    This program aims to shed light on the safety of hunting, as well as the nature of hunting accidents. 
    It draws on two sources of data: hunting accidents nationwide and the number of licenses, tags, permits 
    and stamps acquired each year; this may suggests the popularity of hunting. While the data is
    publicly available, the national incident database appears to be missing pieces of data for some states/years. 

### Research Questions

    The guiding research questions of this project are:
    
     1. What (if any) is the relationship between the number of hunting accidents and the number of hunting licenses, permits, tags and
     stamps acquired annually (i.e. this may suggest the effectiveness of a state's hunting safety rules and regulations)?
    
     2. What is the average accident rate of hunting events over the period in question? 
     This may help quantify the inherent risk of hunting.
     
     3. Find the states with the highest and lowest numbers of accidents, and then compare their safety rules and regulations
     (after controlling for the number of hunting events).
     
     4. Miscellaneous Analytics: other factors can be analyzed, including casualty rate, animal hunted, and tree-stand involvement,
     to help illuminate the safety-status of hunting.
