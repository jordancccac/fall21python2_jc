## Hunting Safety Analytics Final Project 

### Part A: Background 
    
    This program aims to shed light on the safety of hunting, as well as the nature of hunting accidents 
    nationwide and by state between the years of 2010-2021.
    
    It draws on two sources of data: hunting accidents nationwide and the number of licenses, tags, permits 
    and stamps acquired each year. While the data is publicly available, the national incident database 
    appears to be missing pieces of data for some states/years. 


### Part B: Research Questions

    The guiding research questions of this project are:
    
     1. What (if any) is the relationship between the number of hunting accidents and the number of hunting licenses, permits, tags and
stamps acquired annually (i.e. this may suggest the effectiveness of a state's hunting safety rules and regulations)?
    
     2. What is the average accident rate of hunting events over the period in question? 
     
     3. Accident Details: other factors are analyzed, including casualty rate, animals hunted, and tree-stand involvement,
     to help illuminate the safety-status of hunting and trends of accidents. 
     
     Future Research: Find the states with the highest and lowest accident rates, and then compare their safety rules and regulations.

### Part F: Conclusion 
    1. For most states, there appears to be no reliable correlation between an increase in hunting events 
    and an increase in reported accidents, suggesting sufficient safety regulations are in place.
    2. The accident rates for all tested states are far less one, suggesting hunting is safe and very low risk.
    
    
    
    
### Part G: Next Steps 
    Compare the safety rules and regulations of states with a positive correlation with those of no correlation. 
    Find the states with the highest and lowest accident rates, and then compare their safety rules and regulations.
